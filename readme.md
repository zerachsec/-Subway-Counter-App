# 🚇 Subway Counter App

A simple people counter application built with vanilla JavaScript to track the number of people entering a subway station.

## 📋 Features

- **Increment Counter**: Click the INCREMENT button to add +1 to the count
- **Save Entry**: Save the current count to view previous entries
- **Auto Reset**: Counter automatically resets to 0 after saving
- **Entry History**: View all previously saved counts

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- DOM Manipulation

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Click **INCREMENT** to count each person entering
2. Click **SAVE** to record the current count
3. The counter resets to 0 and your entry is saved in the history
4. Previous entries are displayed below the buttons

## 💻 Code Highlights

- Uses `getElementById()` to select DOM elements
- Implements `textContent` to update the UI dynamically
- Event handling with `onclick` attributes
- Simple state management with JavaScript variables
